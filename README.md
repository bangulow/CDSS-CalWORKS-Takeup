University of Chicago Harris Policy Lab Fellows tasked with measuring the California Department of Social Services CalWORKS program take-up. ACS 2019 data for California(statecode-6) data was siphoned to represent the denominator, which is the population with children and living below poverty according to the "poverty" variable indicator in ACS data. The CDSS data was used to identify the numerator in the take-up rate, which was total caseloads receiving cash grant (Part.B-section 8).
